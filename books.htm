Shells pass overhead and explode in a sheet of flame a hundred metres away.’ When Paul Bäumer and his classmates join the army, nothing has prepared them for the death and destruction that they witness. Machine guns, huge artillery shells and poison gas create a nightmare world for these young men and their older comrades. For months and years attack is followed by counter-attack. Will any of Paul’s friends survive long enough to return to their families and loved ones? Will there be a place for them at home, when peace finally comes? Can any of these soldiers make sense of the massive conflict in which they are involved?</p><div align="center"><a href="https://www.idefix.com/Kitap/Garp-Cephesinde-Yeni-Bir-Sey-Yok/Edebiyat/Roman/Dunya-Roman/urunno=0001705918001?gclid=CjwKCAjwmq3kBRB_EiwAJkNDp11Du2VX4K3J2Ljcsn0ZbFIhNbrH3WO_1Ovuj-OiXF9G6x2tJ0dPHBoCqcQQAvD_BwE" style="color: red"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>For buy!</a></div>

Travelers by ship from New York to Buenos Aires find that on board with them is the world champion of chess, an arrogant and unfriendly man. They come together to try their skills against him and are soundly defeated. Then a mysterious passenger steps forward to advise them and their fortunes change. How he came to possess his extraordinary grasp of the game of chess and at what cost lie at the heart of Zweig’s story.</p><div align="center"><a href="https://www.dr.com.tr/Kitap/Satranc/Edebiyat/Roman/Dunya-Roman/urunno=0001782086001" style="color: red"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>For buy!</a></div></div></div>

<div class="col-12 col-md-6"><div class="transbox"><p>Life can turn on a dime—or stumble into the extraordinary, as it does for Jake Epping, a high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine. While grading essays by his GED students, Jake reads a gruesome, enthralling piece penned by janitor Harry Dunning: fifty years ago, Harry somehow survived his father’s sledgehammer slaughter of his entire family. Jake is blown away...but an even more bizarre secret comes to light when Jake’s friend Al, owner of the local diner, enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession—to prevent the Kennedy assassination. How? By stepping through a portal in the diner’s storeroom, and into the era of Ike and Elvis, of big American cars, sock hops, and cigarette smoke... Finding himself in warmhearted Jodie, Texas, Jake begins a new life. But all turns in the road lead to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald. The course of history is about to be rewritten...and become heart-stoppingly suspenseful.</p><div align="center"><a href="https://www.dr.com.tr/kitap/221163/edebiyat/roman/korku-gerilim/urunno=0000000400741" style="color: red"><i class="fas fa-shopping-cart"></i>For buy!</a></div>
